# Crop-Recommendation
This project is a machine learning based web application that helps farmers and agriculture students decide which crop to grow based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH value.

Key Features
Predicts the best suitable crop using a trained ML model, Takes soil and weather parameters as input, Live weather integration using OpenWeather API, Interactive Streamlit UI for easy usage. Displays rainfall & location map with Folium.

Technologies Used
Python, Scikit-learn (ML Model), Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit (Web App), Folium & Streamlit-Folium (Map), OpenWeather API.

 How it Works
User enters soil and weather details, ML model processes the input data, App suggests the most suitable crop for that location, (Optional) Fetch live temperature, humidity & rainfall from OpenWeather.

# Use Case
.This project can be helpful for:- Farmers to make better crop decisions, Agriculture researchers & students for analysis, Smart farming and precision agriculture.
